Blue foods, produces from the oceans, lakes and rivers, are often advocated as a sustainable source of protein crucial to meet global food demand. Blue food consumption provides an opportunity for citizens to take actions that reduce the environmental burden of food production and tackle the climate crisis. Here we used a Spanish high-resolution national dataset (1999 – 2021) as a study case to assess long-term temporal trends in blue food consumption in relation to source and stressors resulting from their production. By aggregating species groups according to source, we found an overall reduction in the consumption of most wild caught species. For farmed species we found a pronounced increase in the consumption of carnivorous fish and an overall decrease of low trophic levels species consumption, such as bivalves. Using published studies, we estimated green-house, nitrogen, and phosphorus emissions per kg consumed per capita to assessed trends in blue food environmental performance. Low performance was associated to high trophic level species intensively farmed in distant regions, such as carnivorous fish (*Salmo salar*), due to high stressor emissions associated to production and transport. Contrary, we found that across all groups, consumption of locally farmed bivalves (*Mytilus galloprovincialis*) was associated with lowest stressor emission, providing an example ‘net-zero’ blue food. Our analysis identified historical trends in environmental performance of blue food consumption, consumer choices that promote an environmentally sustainable diet and highlights vast differences in the sustainability associated with the consumption of aquaculture sourced protein. Given the projected near doubling of global blue food demand by mid-century and the exponential growth in production needed to meet this demand, consumers choices can play a crucial role to ensure sustainable production practices. Therefore, policies that promote the production and consumption of more sustainable blue foods should be developed.
